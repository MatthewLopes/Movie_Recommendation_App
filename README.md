# Project 4: Movie Recommendation

System I: Recommendation based on genres
Suppose you know the user's favorite genre. How would you recommend movies to him/her?

Propose two recommendation schemes along with all necessary technical details.

For example, you can recommend the top-five most popular movies in that genre, then you have to define what you mean by "most popular". Or recommend the top-five highly-rated movies in that genre; again need to define what you mean by highly-rated. (Will the movie that receives only one 5-point review be considered highly rated?) Or recommend the most trendy movies in that genre; define how you measure trendiness.

For this part, you do not really need recommenderlab. Some data waggling/summary tools would be enough.

System II: Collaborative recommendation system
Review two collaborative recommendation algorithms: UBCF and IBCF. (Suggest reading Sec 2.1-2.2 of the recommenderlab tutorial)
